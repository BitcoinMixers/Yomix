## How YoMix Bitcoin Mixer Service Works

YoMix uses a combination of cryptographic and timing techniques to enhance anonymity:

1. **Unique Deposit Address**  
   Users initiate mixing by generating a one‑time deposit address, which is not linked to any personal information.

2. **Fragmentation of Funds**  
   Bitcoin is broken into smaller segments and mixed with other users’ funds, preventing direct association between inputs and outputs.

3. **Randomized Mixing Paths**  
   Each fragment follows randomized and unpredictable paths to prevent pattern recognition via blockchain analysis.

4. **Delayed Redistribution**  
   After a configurable time interval, the mixed coins are redistributed to user‑specified addresses, further diminishing traceability.

These techniques help ensure that the origin and destination of Bitcoin transactions cannot be easily linked.
